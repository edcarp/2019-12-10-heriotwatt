# Feedback: Heriot-Watt 10th/11th Dec 2019

## Unix Shell

### Positive

- Could do with spending a wee bit more time running through the examples. Could also do with defining basic terms like "argument" etc... not great for beginners otherwise great!
- Nice and Loud voice Projection
- So easy to understand everything it was not that applicable
- I like the way introducing unix shell commands

    One Suggestion is to do this kind of workshop in a more comfortable room where the only one bigger screen can show what command is written and output

- Easy to follow tutorial
  - Well Structured
  - I am a beginner with little coding experience and found this very helpful
- interactive
- Worked Well: The follow along references online and all the amazing helpers paying attention to post-it notes
- The help was good! I just think at my level (no experience) I need more time

### Critical

- Wish we could get a compare between the programs used / introduced in the morning and afternoon
- Worked not so well: some broad intro to how coding languages differ eg what is Bash? different from python ...
- Too Fast Paced
- can be a bit fast-paced; maybe slow down a little bit
- I got lost at a point but then while trying to get back on track missed the next point: too fast!
- a bit quick with the code
- rushed through some basic examples which could have been more useful for user not familiar with bash
- very good introduction of unix command
- get lost sometimes but a helper in class was great
- the session was succinct and efficient, enough to get us on our path to use bash . shell for ourselves. the links are really useful too

## Python part 1

### Positive
- Practicing the codes
- useful way to interpret large sets of data with a few lines of code.
- Requires a little bit more structure in the start, perhaps a command list
- the course is quite handy and informative
- Great session, concise and practical
- the presentation is good
- reception is good
- the workshop is well organised
- the exercises we worked through to check knowledge
- help was also good

### Critical
- simpler instructions for those with low / no previous knowledge
- Would be great id speak a bit louder
- the room should have sign that class in progress
- at times it was too fast or I can't hear the instruction
- maybe a little slow
- got a little lost and attention lost nearer the end
- more practical should of be employed
- presume I know nothing because even the most simple and obvious thing to you makes no sense to me (like when fractions have to be explained with pizza for kids)

## Git

### Positive
- Today's session is better paced so far
- The course ran a lot smoother today
- The session was so good, I learned a lot
- Well Presented, excellent hands-on tools
- Shown how to use basic of GitHub and how to resolve conflicts
- Nice intro about GitHub
- overall it is beneficial for me
- I liked it all
- Github pretty cool and i can see why it can be used in certain scenarios
- good comprehensive guide to using git
- Very Clear instructions and easy to follow
- very good pace
- good introduction to git, nicely shows you were to find tools to get you up to speed in your own time.
- github is new to me so the step-by-step instruction was really helpful. It is also good sometimes to let us get error so we know what mistakes can be made and how to fix them.
- good to learn the basics of writing bash scripts. Bash / git instructor very good at taking through step by step.


### Critical
- Doing stuff through the command prompt seems redundant and non-intuitive after we've been shown how to use the GitHub Desktop App
- the terminal is harder to use efficiently
- basic concepts
- Very quickly moved through concepts. May need more time to go over, however realise time is very limited
- More examples for hands-on experience workshop about tech related
- conduct examples more frequently
- it would have helped if we could have access to whatever the instructor is typing
- Remember to ask attendees to download GitDesktop Before the course
- there is quite a lot of "empty space" during the sessions when we are waiting for others to get up to speed we waste a lot of time doing nothing. Could have more concrete example workthrough[sic] exercises
- It would be nice if the examples shown on screen were then explained for other GUI because it gets very confusing. Also (I know we're time limited) but that was too fast.

## Python part 2

### Positive
- help throughout was good. The explanation help sheets are good
- clear exercises and good content that covers all the basics of python. Can take away new knowledge to develop on my own research.
- Assistance during workshop
- Assistance on issues was very good

### Critical
- Would be better is use microphone (louder voice)
- location has too much ambient noise, be it vents or people coming in and out of the room, makes it harder ti hear especially the python instructor who speaks quieter. Too many large programmes done in interpreter and not text editor. All the copy pasting was painful.
- Noise from outside the room
- speaker was very quiet
