- Would have like to have seen - for loops: 2, script files: 1

Other:

- "Some commands need a bit more time to practice"
- "Although explanations were clear, transitions between basics was quick"
- "Language of staff could be worked on, ... , shouldn't use 'this is very easy/basic' etc."

# Git feedback

## The Good

* very useful topic, especially for people working on programming.
* very useful specially when collaborating with others.
* "Great session"
* I have learned a basic background about git to know where I should
  start to learn.
* The Git Code Connectivity[?] is a gret tool.
* It is clear and the purpose was simple & extremely important. Also,
  the helpers were experts.
* Great introduction to Git. I appreciate the the time is limited 
  but it would have been nice to have a little bit on branches
* Very useful for organising research and data files
* Learned New material and it's all good. Although it's somehow difficult
  How to integrate it with gnerytray's[?] research Acivities
* Very helpful staff
* Excellent. Very useful info.
* Excellent, very useful
* Helpful infornation. Very good helpers.
* v. interesting to learn another way to collaborate on documents
  (other than google) :) The guys that are supporting us make a
  huge difference to the flow of the workshop (but where are the 
  girls today?)
* The introduction and the use of github
* Good to learn interaction with partner/collaborators on GitHub
* The lecture is very useful and clearly structured. Thanks! The
  staff working around are ver helpful and knowledgable. Thanks.
* Good instruction. Good delay btn instruction and coding.
* Great help and support in course
* Things are helpful.
* Very straightfoward. Happy with the pace. Tip: type/copy the 
  code into etherpad so we can go back if missed.

## The bad


* the course was a bit fast paced. Also people are not familiar with
  the comments so, when you type sth please don't cover it up with 
  other windows.
* This session was on fast track. Pace of delivery should be slightly
  slow :)
* The git course wasn't performed simultaneously with us. It was too
  fast.
* Nothing, just thanks!
* "Could have been great if the example using "real code" like 
   merging[?] a [sic] already writtn function or code
* I find it difficult to get my way around the collaborative work and
  merger
* The application of Git and GitHub are not clear.To me, it looks, it
  adds another layer of Complexity which is hard to justify.
* Difficult to follow and try to reproduce the results simultaneously
* No complaints
* Print out some commands to help understand the exercises. Prepare
  more clear examples for future trainings on git.
* Was too fast ti get
* sometimes it was too quick and hard to keep track (for somebeody 
  that is a bit lost from the beginning)
* The lst group practice should be more breakdown into
  - adding one line from both contributor[s]
  - then overap and see the change
* It was too fast to follow each step while applying by myself
* Improve preparation of content for limited time.


# Python Feedback 1


## Positive

Great/excellent session/job/experience 6

Informative/Great for beginners/Interesting/Helpful 3

Helpers did a good job 3

Good flow and dynamics

Pace was good

Good delay between explanations and coding

Instructor goes through examples easily and confidently

Instructor is very patient and clear

Clear and friendly

Very hands on

Helps to think like a programmer

Examples were good

Well presented and light-hearted

Good idea to let people think about the solution to a problem


## Negative

The pace was very fast, more detailed explanation needed. Most people were not following at all.

Could be longer, with a special intro for those who never used programming before.

Needs to be longer + too much information 3

More in-depth data analysis examples

Should understand ipython functions first

Go faster through the first couple of chapters and give more time for the others

Preference for covering topics more quickly

Decrease the material / too long 3

Give more time for exercises

More examples 

Data science terminology should be explained better

All good / no negative feedback 6


# Python Feedback 2

## Positive 

All good/perfect/excellent 7

Well managed

Will improve my research skills, although I had experience with other languages 

Nice -- keep offering this at different skill levels

Easy to understand

Motivating and inspiring

The section on defensive programming was excellent

Covered all the basics

Syntax error [?]

Create a wiki with terms of programming lingo and basic concepts for dummies


## Negative

No negative feedback/empty post-it 6

Explain the advantages of python over using other languages. 2

I felt we got stuck on arithmetics. Shell is not necessary to learn python, I would use that time for more python

Too long -- maybe distribute on three days

More time and more classes needed 2

Show references to more complex examples of programs

Introduce types more explicitly. Check people's pace, a few gave up

Define "function"
